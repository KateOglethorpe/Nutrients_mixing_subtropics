Six output files & MATLAB code for research project: "The Role of Mesoscale Eddy Stirring and Microscale Turbulence in Sustaining Biological Production in Subtropical Gyres."

Estimates of nitrate supply by mesoscale eddy stirring and microscale turbulence to the winter mixed layer (wml) and thermocline (therm), where supply by mesoscale eddy stirring is obtained from convergences of the isopycnal diffusive ntirate fluxes (F_iso_diff) and supply by microscale turbulence is obtained from the sum of convergences of the diapycnal diffusive nitrate fluxes (F_dia_diff) and diapycnal advective nitrate fluxes (F_dia_adv).
